# prettier-stylelint-conflict
Sample test code to illustrate incoherent stylelint behaviour


yarn run fix-ko:

works pretty well without errors, eslint --fix works nicely, but stylelint --fix does not fix all the issues that would be fixed by running stylelint yarn run stylelint --fix standalone


yarn run fix-ok:

by running stylelint --fix twice, the errors caught on yarn run stylelint are caught and fixed nicely.
